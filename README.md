# StanchionJS

**[Work in progress]**

A simple & fast queue done right. backed by Redis, supports auto-reconnect, TypeScript, Promise and Rxjs.


## Features

- **Fast.** Just `BLPOP` and `RPUSH`, no other fancy stuff, simple and fast.

- **Auto-Reconnect.**

- **Works with Promise.** Unleash the power of `async / await`, say bye-bye to callback.

- **Better error handling.**

- **Written in TypeScript.** No hacky code and provides better experience if you are using `TypeScript`.

- **Reactive.** If you don't like making promises, there're reactive APIs too.


## Installation
